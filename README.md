# Project Title

University of Bamberg Assignments to create Chat/Collaboration Web Apps

## Description

The assignments include first building client and server for a simple chat app, where clients can register on a server and participate in a group chat, WebRTC was used as connection mechanism. Please see assignment_02 for a usable implementation.

The other project from assignment_03 on included building a colaboration tool with text and video chat aswell as a simple drawing board that I implemented with creative use of event handlers and node module Automerge. It is a peer2peer app using PeerJS. See assignment_6 for usable implementation using PeerJs Cloud solution.
